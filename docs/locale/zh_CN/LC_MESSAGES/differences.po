"Slim has the ( ``'`` ), ( ``='`` ), and ( ``=='`` ) `line indicators "
"<https://github.com/slim-template/slim#line-indicators>`_. In Plim, single "
"quote has been replaced by the comma char ( ``,`` ):"

"Slim 中有 ( ``'`` )、( ``='`` )、( ``=='`` ) ` 三种行内指示符（line indicators）"
"<https://github.com/stonean/slim#line-indicators>`_ 。Plim 使用 ``,`` 代替 ``'``。"

"The change was made in order to get rid of the syntactic ambiguities like "

"Meanwhile, the comma char is not allowed at the beginning of python "
"expression, therefore the following code samples are consistent:"

"然而 Python 表达式不允许以逗号起始，因此下面的例子并不会产生歧义"

"In addition, the comma syntax seems more natural, since in formal writing we"
" also add a whitespace between a comma and the following word (in contrast "
"to apostrophes, which may be written together with some parts of words - "
"\"I'm\", \"it's\" etc)."
msgstr ""
"另外，使用逗号相比引号也更自然，因为我们在书写普通英文单词，如 “I'm”、“it's” 时也会使用单引号。"

"Unlike Slim, Plim does not support square or curly braces for wrapping tag "
"attributes. You can use only parentheses ``()``:"

"For example, in Slim you would write ``-if``, ``-for``, and ``coffee:`` "
"(without preceding dash, but with the colon sign at the tail). But in Plim, "
"you must write ``-if``, ``-for``, and ``-coffee``."
msgstr ""
"在 Slim 中你需要写 ``-if``、``-for`` 以及 ``coffee:`` ，"
